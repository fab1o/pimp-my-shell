This Oh My Posh theme is **loosely inspired** by the classic [robbyrussell Oh My Zsh theme](https://ohmyz.sh/).  
The corresponding [Oh My Posh version](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/themes#robbyrussell) had a [known issue](https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/pimp-my-shell/issues/6204) where the ‚úó character was incorrectly configured ‚Äî this theme fixes that.
